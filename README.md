# Firmware
APRIL 2025
The RepRapFirmwareOrca folder contains the latest firmware release & configuration specifically for Orca Slicer. The settings in config.g may not work with gcode files sliced by earlier SeeMeCNC setups. So it was necessary to make a new repository where current firmware is stored. 

===============================================================


Repetier firmware for all RAMBo controlled SeeMeCNC 3D Printers. One firmware, configuarable for all RAMBo deltas. 

This firmware is based off of Repetier Firmware, through many years and versions, as well as some integration with features of marlin and others work.  


===============================================================

RepRapFirmware is led by works by Duet3d, ltd.  The open source software here is a direct copy form the Duet3d repositories on github. The difference are the settings for SeeMeCNC 3D printers. Please refer to SeeMeCNC instructions, guides, or Service Bulletins when using the software.
